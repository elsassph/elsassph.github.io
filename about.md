## Work

I’m UI Architect at [Deltatre](https://deltatre.com) (formerly Massive), which means I tend to code less than I ensure projects are delivered in good conditions. We do video streaming apps.

I’m a coder and a trainer at heart, specialised in the web stack – TypeScript, JavaScript and Haxe-JS, from browsers to TVs and consoles. I like to tune our Webpack builds and Continuous Integration.

In a previous life I used to do a lot of cool Flash productions in web agencies before it went out of fashion; now I want to create apps that people care about.

## Opensource

I was in OSS before Github was a thing, kids!

Nowadays I’m running a number of focused projects, a lot around the [Haxe](https://haxe.org) language, and contribute regularly to JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

Previously I dedicated years to [FlashDevelop](https://flashdevelop.org/) (also branded as [HaxeDevelop](https://haxedevelop.org/)), an ActionScript and Haxe IDE - arguably the best free ActionScript IDE there was during the golden age of Flash development.
